# Oppeos™ Inc 
### Terms and Conditions
#### V1.2 

We here at Oppeos Incorporated international intergalactic headquarters understand that legal jargon can be annoying and overwhelming.  It’s actually oftentimes hard to understand but more importantly boring to read.  We have done everything in our power to make them understandable reading material for you.  Moreso we want you to know that we are happy you have chosen our site and trust us with your creativity, advertising needs, and open space.  We have done everything in our power to make our terms fair and groovy.  If you have questions or want to grow up to become a lawyer one day, feel free to contact us at oppeos at oppeos dot com.  We’ll be happy to chat about any of the following.  (This paragraph is not part of the official terms and conditions).  We at Oppeos INC. believe in trusting humans first.  So just do good with everything and do your best, act in your best nature. Judge things using your good side of your brain and everything should be fine. If not, here is what we have to do to explain things and have a legal document that protects everyone.  It’s like the Constitution of the United States but for the virtual reality and real world experiences done by way of Oppeos.  Welcome to the new generation of advertising, which we call invertizing.  Advertising was always more annoying than legal words, so we thought.  That’s why the future of _invertizing™_ includes advertising products you already use, you want to use or are choosing to advertise “_in_” your life. Get it?  And that is your first lesson in legal wordology.  Things have to be defined before they can be used.  So we created our own language cause the future is being defined by… us.  Help be a part of the future as an Oppeon, Closeon or Spacehunter.  
PS- We did make a bullet point list to simplify the following super long agreement.  

Now, the legal stuff☺
