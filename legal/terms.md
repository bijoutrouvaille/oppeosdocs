## Oppeos Website Terms and Conditions

### Welcome

Welcome to the oppeos terms page. We'll try to make it as simple as possible for you as we set out these hard legal rules. Our idea of these is simple: if you aren't out to steal, cheat or abuse, if you are an honest and law-abiding citizen of the Internet, then chances are that your good sense is enough to make use of this platform in a way that's beneficial to yourself and others. Still, while we try our best to serve everyone by providing a safe and supportive place to trade, we cannot be responsible for everyone or guarantee anyone's safety. Finally, because this software is extremaly complex, it is bound to have bugs. This software is also meant to be used by a huge number of people, and so we cannot be held liable for any damage due to bugs. Such is the nature of most software, including ours. Welcome to the adventure, but enter at your own risk.

The preceding paragraph, however, is not the agreement. The agreement starts below.

### Definitions

- An __oppeo__ is an open space, either digital or physical, posted for sale on the Website, which can be filled with an advertizement for a price.
- A __closeo__ is a product, brand, image or other content to be advertized.
- An __oppeon__ is a user posting open space for sale on oppeos.io website.
- A __closeon__ is a user posting a public closeo, or a user purchasing or intending to purchase an oppeo.
- A __spacehunter__ is a third party agent, unaffiliated with the Company, who is tasked with connecting oppeons and closeons and whose compensation is a percentage of sales the agent generated.
- A __uniqleo__ is the resultant advertisement of the closeo performed by the oppeon for the closeon. It may come in the form of digital or physical media and/or action.
- Invertizing is a form of unique and native advertising whereupon the product, brand or logo (event or promotion or service) are advertising in the “flow” of the media and medium to which it is being consumed without “adverting” the consciousness of the viewer or participator. 

The Website is a marketplace, where closeons can purchase oppeos from oppeons for their closeos. Thus oppeons are sellers and closeons are buyers on the Website. The Company does not bear responsibility for the spacehunters or their interactions with buyers and sellers, however, it does reserve the right to settle any and all disputes which arise from such interactions.
