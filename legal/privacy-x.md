Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers, payment systems, data storage, Closeons, or any API’s that we may use). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

### Analytics

We collect and use third party analytics data with analytics information from other users so that it cannot be used to identify any particular individual person or agency.  If you are a robot then we are impressed and will collect your information because you do not have rights to it.

Metadata added to Uniquleos is important and required in order to use the site.  We have to be able to prove Oppeons advertised as they agreed to.  Therefore, any metadata (hashtags, geolocations including gps coordinates, images, videos, comments, screenshots associated, descriptions) will be visible by the public.

This may be reversed and we may need to share information provided to us or gathered by us to an Oppeo by a Closeon to make sure the Oppeon can fulfill the Insertion Order.
