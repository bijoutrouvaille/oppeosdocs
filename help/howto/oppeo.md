In order to sell oppeos, you must submit our merchant application and become an approved merchant. If you haven't done that yet, you'll be taken there automatically. You can follow [these instructions](/help/howto/merchant.md), if you need help.

Once done, add a picture to attract the eye of the Closeo, by dropping a file within the dashed lines or by clicking inside them and selecting a file from your computer.

Once you have added the picture, move and adjust the displayed marquee to crop the picture to our required aspect ratio.  Then, click Upload or cancel to try again.

Enter the name that you would like displayed on Oppeos.  This will be the title of your oppeo and will be the first text that will be seen in listings.

Once you have entered a Display name, select a Category. Click on the arrow on the far right of the display box and use the scroll bar to select from the presented options. Categories help Closeos and advertisers find the medium or style of invertizing they need.

Other categories include:  Shorts, Social, and Websites

Enter your Price:  How much will you charge for creating this oppeo?

Audience Size:  How many followers do you have, or how many people do you expect will see your oppeo?

Record Interactions: Have you gone viral before? How many total likes, shares, conversations, purchases, and such did you get? What's your record? Remember, interactions are not the same as views. In order to be effective, your goal should be user's engagement. You want them to ask questions, to repost and tell others about it.

As an option, you may enter the quantity that you would like to sell: if filled in, this oppeo will automatically unpublish itself when the quantity runs out.

Also as an option, you may enter your Zip Code:  if your oppeo makes sense locally, enter a zip code.

Add a description:  What are you going to do for the money you get? Remember, audience quality matters more than their quantity; that is the invertizing way. Represent your people.
