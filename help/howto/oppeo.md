### When can you deliver the goods?  Immediately or will it take you 6 months from funding to finish your film or that social media post until it's just right.  Can you put invertizing into your open space in just 5 minutes or as soon as the advertiser sends you the product?  (Don't be a slack, there is cash on the table people).

### Advertisers as called CLOSEOS because they fill your Open Space with brands, products, or logos.

### OPPEOS are Creative

### You are a creative person in the "flow" taking avertising to the next level.  Into "Invertizing".  Old ads used to be annoying because they took your attention away from what you wanted to see or do.  Bad advertising creates ADD, deression and dislike of the brand.

### OPPEOS Invertzing is in the flow.
