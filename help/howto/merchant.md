### Step 2 

**Venmo** is a very important aspect of Oppeos.  Venmo is how you get paid. A Vemno email is just like a PayPal email, but simpler. 

If you are already a member of Venmo, please put your Venmo email here so that you can recieve any money that is due you.  If you are not a member, please follow the steps to completing the Venmo sign-up process and then come back to Oppeos.io and enter your new venmo email.

Once you enter your Venmo email, please click the "continue" button.

Sorry to ask, but Oppeos.io's payment gateway requires our merchants to provide their SSN for verfication purposes.  It's a requirement by the payment processor Braintree, and we will keep your information safe and sound.
