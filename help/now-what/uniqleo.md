# Now What Uniqleo

First of all, good job! It's hard to make a good uniqleo, and now your hard work is being reviewed by your closeon. We feel you, and are here to help. Now there are two things to watch for:

1. If the closeon is not completely happy, he or she will contact us, and we'll contact you in return to make the best uniqleo possible. Make sure to keep an eye our for emails from oppeos@oppeos.io.
2. If after the 7 day grace period, the closeon doesn't do anything, then we'll release your money. Make sure that they email you've supplied on your merchant application is linked with your VENMO. You'll need an account there to get paid.
