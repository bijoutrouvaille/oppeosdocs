# Now what purchase

You paid for an oppeo? What do you do? What should you expect?

Now you sit tight. The oppeon is probably already working on your uniqleo. A uniqleo may take a few days, a week or longer. The time it takes depends on the kind of oppeo. Generally, an opeon is expected to _campaign_ your closeo. That means making posts, talking to people online and in person. Usually, you wouldn't want a campaign that is too short.

Once the oppeon completes the uniqleo, you'll get an email. From that moment, you'll have one week to examine the work, and only then the oppeon gets paid. If you are unsatisfied during this 7 day grace period, let us know (oppeos@oppeos.io)! We'll work with you and the oppeon in order to make the best uniqleo possible.

Meanwhile, why stop at just one? The wonders of oppeos are [waiting for you](/search/oppeos)!
