### How to make a kick ass OPPEO?

Where is your Open Space?  On a social media site?  In a feature film you're writing?  In a commercial or photo or on your front lawn?

Make sure you took a good  picture.  Use filters and get serious, creatively. This is where it gets decided if you are worthy or not.  Show your creative side with a darn good shot!  It's gonna sell ya or send you.

Who are you in a few words? (Your followers are just like you so advertisers know who you reach).

When can you deliver the goods?  Immediately or will it take you 6 months from funding to finish your film or that social media post until it's just right.  Can you put invertizing into your open space in just 5 minutes or as soon as the advertiser sends you the product?  (Don't be a slack, there is cash on the table people).

How long is your campaign?  Will you be promoting a T-shirt at school for one day, or reposting 30 pictures of you playing with the next transformer for 5 days, 10 days, or 60 days?  We know most online media lives for infinity.  But this is your time to shine.  You can post as many times, make as many comments, and share as much as you want.  The more you share, the more value you create.  We track your success within the time you commit. Deliver more, so that you can charge more!

Advertisers are called CLOSEOS because they close your Open Space with brands, products, or logos.

#### OPPEOS are Creative

You are a creative person in the "flow," taking avertising to the next level.  Into "Invertizing".  Old ads used to be annoying because they took your attention away from what you wanted to see or do.  Bad advertising creates ADD, depression and dislike of the brand.
