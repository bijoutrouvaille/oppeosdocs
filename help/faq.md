## FAQ

### HOW DOES IT WORK?

Oppeos.com is a marketplace where anyone can buy or sell oppeos. An oppeo is an open space for marketing. It is a marketing campaign performed by the seller for the buyer. Examples could include anything from a single social media post, to a weeklong social media campaign, a product placement in an upcoming film or video game, or simply a day of wearing a t-shirt with your logo on it. The brand or product to be advertized is called a closeo.

### HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?

The space owner, i.e. the oppeon, sets the purchase price for each oppeo. An 18% commission percentage goes to Oppeos Inc for the platform service.

### HOW DO I KNOW MY OPPEOS SOLD?

A notification is sent via email, so please make sure that yours is accurate in your [account settings](/dash/account).

### WHEN DO OPPEONS GET THEIR MONEY?

The money is placed on hold in an Escrow account until the purchase is complete. 7-9 days after the oppeon marks the transaction as finished by uploading the uniqleo, the money is released from Escrow into the Oppeon's [venmo.com](https://venmo.com) account.

### HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?

It is up to the oppeon to place the product, logo or brand agreed upon by both parties into the purchased space. The oppeon agrees to a timely delivery of the product.

### WHAT IS IN IT FOR CLOSEONS?

Targeted market, low cpm, interactive immersive word of mouth, personal advertising, combined with traditional recall tactics driving direct action.
