## FAQ

### WHERE CAN I GET HELP?

Our friendly and resourceful support crew is reachable by email oppeos@oppeos.io.

### HOW DOES IT WORK?

Oppeos.io is a marketplace where anyone can buy or sell oppeos. An oppeo is an open space for marketing. It is a marketing campaign performed by the seller for the buyer. Examples could include anything from a single social media post, to a weeklong social media campaign, a product placement in an upcoming film or video game, or simply a day of wearing a t-shirt with your logo on it. The brand or product to be advertized is called a closeo.

### HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?

The space owner, i.e. the oppeon, sets the purchase price for each oppeo. An 18% commission percentage goes to Oppeos Inc for the platform service.

### HOW DO I KNOW MY OPPEOS SOLD?

A notification is sent via email, so please make sure that yours is accurate in your [account settings](/dash/account).

### WHEN DO OPPEONS GET THEIR MONEY?

The money is placed on hold in an Escrow account until the campaign is marked finished by completing the uniqleo on the transaction page. 7-9 days after the oppeon marks the transaction as finished, the money is released from Escrow into the Oppeon's [venmo.com](https://venmo.com) account.

### REFUNDS

The Oppeos platform provides an excellent safety mechanism for your purchases. Money from the sale does not go to the OPPEON (the seller) immediately. Instead it goes to a special "Escrow" account. Once the oppeon marks the service complete, by uploading a UNIQLEO, the CLOSEON (the buyer) has 7 days to accept the work or request improvements or refunds. 

If the uniqleo that you paid for is unsatisfactory, please contact oppeos@oppeos.io during the 7 day review period, and we will work with you and the oppeon to make improvements, or issue a full refund. Please note, it is up to the customer service team to decide whether or not to refund. Refunds are also impossible, if requested after the 7 day review period has expired.

### HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?

It is up to the oppeon to place the product, logo or brand agreed upon by both parties into the purchased space. The oppeon agrees to a timely delivery of the product.

### WHAT IS IN IT FOR CLOSEONS?

Targeted market, low cpm, interactive immersive word of mouth, personal advertising, combined with traditional recall tactics driving direct action.

### WHAT IS A DISCLOSURE?

If you are making online invertizing/advertizing posts, you are required by law to clearly disclose the fact that you are being paid to do so. Usually, a hashtag ad along with the closeo name is enough, e.g. __#ad Tesla Motors__. We cannot give you legal advice, however, and you are required to personally learn the FTC regulations as they apply to you. You can learn about the regulations by visiting FTC at the following address: https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/native-advertising-guide-businesses.

### A DICTIONARY, PLEASE

- oppeo: a white-label invertizing campaign
- invertizing: advertising adverts the flow, invertizing flows with it. There shouldn't be a need for faking anything or annoying anyone to promote a good thing. Do you like a product? Then tell your community about it and get paid so that you can keep on contributing. Everyone wins.
- closeo: a product or brand to invertize.
- oppeon: the seller of the oppeo.
- closeon: the buyer of the oppeo.
- uniqleo: finished oppeo + closeo = uniqleo. It is the public record of finished work with a photo, a description, acheived numbers and links to results.
- spacehunter: independent agent, connecting oppeons and closeons for a 10% commission. Currently all spacehunters are thoroughly vetted by Oppeos Inc, although in the future we plan to open spacehunting opportunities to everyone.
